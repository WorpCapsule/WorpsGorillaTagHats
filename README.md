# WorpsGorillaTagHats
First release! 
Hats that I made that work. When I make new ones it will be updated.
I own these. The GrassTopper was based off of bobbies tophat, I just added a different material to it.
Do not redistribute the hats without my permisson. Dm me on discord at Anonymous701pr3a2e929z93#7646 to ask for my permisson.
Have fun with the cosmetics!

"WorpCapsule, what do you use?" Well, I use unity, github, and blender to make stuff, i'm also learning how to make custom maps. Mostly, I use unity to make custom maps, hats, and materials. Blender helps me with the gorilla tag model and make animated materials. Github gives me my utils to make stuff like this, like https://github.com/legoandmars/GorillaCosmeticsUnityProject and https://github.com/legoandmars/GorillaTagMapProject/releases/tag/1.1.0. And discord, (especially the cosmetics server) gives me the extra help I need.
